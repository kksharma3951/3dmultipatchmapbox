# 3D Multipatch Mapbox - Project Context

## Current Status: WORKING ✅

The visualization is now working correctly with proper building heights and multi-level roof details preserved.

## The Fix (Completed)

**Root Cause:** We weren't passing `relative_h=True` to `process_multipatch_file()` on line 159 of converter.py.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `relative_h=True` parameter to convert absolute elevations to relative heights
- Updated HTML to properly use `base_height` and `top_height` fields
- Result: Beautiful multi-level roof structures with realistic heights (average ~38m)

**Current Visualization:**
- 26,091 buildings displayed
- Average height: 38.3m (realistic for downtown buildings)
- Multi-level roof complexity preserved
- Buildings look correct and proportional

## Repository Cleanup (Completed)

**Removed:**
- `feature/multi-level-heights` branch (both local and remote)
- All experimental converter files:
  - converter_adjusted.py
  - converter_attributes.py
  - converter_correct.py
  - converter_fixed.py
  - converter_multipolygon.py
  - converter_original.py
  - converter_original_relative.py
  - converter_simple.py
  - original_multipatch_convertor.py
- Debug files: debug.html, debug_data.py, nul

## Next Steps: Full Stack Development

### Phase 1: Streamlit POC
Create a Python-based proof of concept with Streamlit:
- File upload interface for multipatch shapefiles
- Real-time conversion and visualization
- Interactive parameter adjustment
- Export capabilities

### Phase 2: CABINS Integration
Integrate the multipatch visualization into the CABINS full-stack app:
- Backend API for multipatch processing
- Frontend 3D visualization component
- Database integration for building data
- User management and project organization

## Technical Details

### Working Converter Logic
```python
# Line 159 in converter.py
features, crs = process_multipatch_file(shapefile, relative_h=True)
```

### Data Structure
- Each multipatch building is exploded into individual polygon parts
- Each part has: min_z, max_z, height, base_height, top_height
- Heights are relative to ground elevation (GRD_ELEV_2 field)

### Visualization Stack
- **Backend:** Python + geopandas + shapely
- **Frontend:** Mapbox GL JS with fill-extrusion layer
- **Data Format:** GeoJSON with 3D properties

## Key Insights Learned

1. **Absolute vs Relative Heights:**
   - Multipatch data contains absolute elevations (~1046-1289m)
   - Web visualization needs relative heights from ground
   - The `relative_h=True` parameter handles this conversion

2. **Multi-level Structures:**
   - Multipatch contains beautiful 3D roof detail
   - Each building can have multiple polygon parts at different heights
   - Preserving this detail requires proper base_height and top_height

3. **Reference Code:**
   - bbonczak's multipatch_convertor was the key reference
   - Original implementation had the solution all along
   - Sometimes the simple solution is the right one
